      <h2>Welcome to the Harbours of Hope Project</h2>
      <p>Our project, undertaken by a group of students, seeks to deepen comprehension of the Mediterranean migration
        crisis by visualizing migrant youth-related data. Through interactive charts and graphs, we endeavor to
        illuminate their challenges and triumphs amid arduous journeys. This project is part of our coursework in
        Interactive Information Visualization, and our main goal is to contribute meaningfully to the understanding of
        migration dynamics.</p>

      <h3>About the Visualizations</h3>
      <p> Our visualizations provide a comparative analysis of educational achievements and employment statuses among
        young migrants across various EU countries. They illuminate disparities and commonalities, shedding light on the
        diverse outcomes resulting from migrant integration policies. Serving as a valuable resource, these
        visualizations cater to researchers, humanitarian organizations, policymakers, and socially conscious
        individuals, fostering informed decision-making and engagement. Understanding these patterns is pivotal in
        addressing the educational and employment challenges faced by migrant youth, driving the development of more
        effective support systems and inclusive policies. Users can navigate the visualizations by selecting specific
        years, with flags representing different EU countries and their placement indicating key education and
        employment statistics. Additionally, the size of each flag corresponds to the migrant youth population,
        providing a visual representation of the data's signifitrong>How:</strong> Navigate through the visualization by
