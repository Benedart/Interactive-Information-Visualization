    <h2>Employment Rate vs Educational Attainment (2014-2022)</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This graph compares the employment rate (Y-axis) against the level of education
      (X-axis) of young immigrants aged between 18 and 25 years in European countries.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The employment rate is the percentage of immigrants who are employed out of the total
      (all immigrants living in that country).</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The educational attainment is the percentage of immigrants between the ages of 18 and
      25 who have continued with their higher education (university, vocational training...) out of the total (all
      immigrants aged between 18 and 25 living in that country).</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Education and employment rate are represented by the position of the flags, while the
      total migrant population of each country is represented by their sizes.</p>
